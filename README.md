# tetris
tetris using pygame (Python3)

For executing this file, you will need to have pygame installed in your system. Also I have used Python3 in this file. So if you are using lower versions of Python then this might not work properly.

There are some bugs regarding landing of falling of blocks which will be updated soon.

Also there is no feature fo counting the score, which also will be added soon.

Enjoy tetris! :)
